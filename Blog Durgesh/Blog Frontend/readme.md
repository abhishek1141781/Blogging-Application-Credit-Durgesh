Why ReactJs
SPA
makes changes in VDom first and then browser DOM


IMPLEMENTATIONS:
1) Profile Page
2) Login/Logout Functionality
3) CRUD Implemented
4) State management using useState and useEffect
5) Global variables using contextApi
6) Saving login information on LocalStorage 

1. **Routing**: Implement client-side routing using a library like `react-router-dom` to create multiple pages or views within your application.
2. **Components**: Organize your UI into reusable components. Common components may include headers, footers, navigation menus, and content sections.
3. **State Management**: Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing component-level state. For global state management, consider using tools like Redux or the Context API.
4. **API Integration**: Fetch and send data to a backend server or API using libraries like `axios` or the `fetch` API. Handle data asynchronously using promises or async/await.
5. **Forms**: Create forms for user input, handle form submissions, and validate user data. Utilize controlled components to manage form state.
6. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization features, allowing users to sign up, log in, log out, and access protected routes.
7. **User Interfaces**: Design and style your application using CSS, CSS frameworks (ReactStrap), or CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components).
8. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms, including displaying error messages to users when something goes wrong using toastify from ReactStrap
9. **Navigation**: Create navigation menus, breadcrumbs, and links to help users navigate through your application.
10. **File Upload**: If required, allow users to upload files (images, documents, etc.) and handle file storage on the server.
11. **Data Display**: Display data from APIs or databases in lists, tables, cards, or other UI components. Implement features like pagination or infinite scrolling if dealing with large datasets.
13. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your application looks and works well on various screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
14. **Toast Notifications**: Implement toast notifications to provide feedback to users for actions like form submissions or successful updates.
